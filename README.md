# üñäÔ∏è Todo App built using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) and Material UI
## This is a super simple Todo App built using React.js and styled using Material UI.

It uses the [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) to manage state, [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) for design, [Wouter](https://github.com/molefrog/wouter) for routing and [`localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) to store todos

### You can view it here: https://maxtodos.netlify.app/

- Add todo
